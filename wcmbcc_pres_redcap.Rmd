In this presentation, I'll talk a little about the concepts of reproducbility and modifiability, how those two
concepts are often in conflict when working with data, and how they *might* be reconciled in some very specific
but useful cases.

So -- as people who work with data, we may think of reproducibility as a way to ensure our inputs yield
the same outputs via a series of codified actions, no matter who is performing the actions and in what context.
Any changes to the inputs are not permanent but rather preserved in a separate output.

# MODIFIABLE

DATA&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; NEW DATA

&nbsp;

???

Since this is the case, the concept of modifiability might seem to run counter to reproducibility. How can an
output or process be reproducible if we can irreversibly modify it?

We've all come across common ways to modify data:

# MODIFIABLE

DATA&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; .cardinal[EXCEL]&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; NEW DATA

&nbsp;

???

With perhaps the most infamous being directly editing data in an Excel spreadhseet.

# MODIFIABLE

DATA&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; .cardinal[EXCEL]&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; NEW DATA

`r emo::ji("scream")` `r emo::ji("scream")` `r emo::ji("scream")`

class: center, middle

# MODIFIABLE

DATA&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; .cardinal[RE-DOWNLOAD]&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; NEW DATA

&nbsp;

???

However, redownloading a dataset from a regularly-updated backend source without preserving separate versions
is just as common.

# MODIFIABLE

DATA&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; .cardinal[RE-DOWNLOAD]&nbsp; `r emo::ji("arrow_right")` &nbsp; NEW DATA

`r emo::ji("grimace")` `r emo::ji("grimace")` `r emo::ji("grimace")`

And so, it seems we're left at a standoff, with reproducibility and modifiability vying for your data.

However, are there instances where modifiability can be incorporated into reproducibility? Are 
there scenarios where modifiability is actually useful to scientific pursuits?

My goal today is to convince you of my **very** tentative yes to both of these questions. In my
limited experience, I've found a few scenarios in which your data can be gently cradled by both
reproducibility and modifiability, carried towards your ultimate analytic goals.

# MODIFIABILITY CAN BE USEFUL!

Outline:
  - Scenarios where modifiability can be **carefully** explored
  - Scenarios where modifiability is NOT okay (from irresponsible to malicious/misleading)
  - One solution: REDCapR API
    - Allows backend R pipeline feeding frontend REDCap (manually-abstractable)
    - (Also reproducible SQL pipeline from SQL to R (more on that in another presentation, maybe!))
    - Pros:
      - If data simply cannot be programmatically created (complex, unwieldy, etc.) - individuals may choose to manually abstract
      - Easy-to-use, already-available platform that many PIs are familiar with (vs. SQL)
    - Cons:
      - For safety, need to ensure robust systems for data backup (not default/built in, but not terribly difficult)
